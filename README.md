# My Photos

## Overview
This application is called my photos.  It shows people a list of photos I liked
and provides the user ability to comment and upvote photos.  This is an ongoing
project to be refactored and more features built in.  

## Technical
The Front end is built with React.js and Redux.js store.  
I am using redux as a state manager with react components for UI.

Back end is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework.  There is no
database used in this application.

The application is hosted on Heroku.
